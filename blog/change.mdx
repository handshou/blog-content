I’m taking a pretty big step, deleting my instagram and moving on completely. Also, moving away from my old stuff by throwing sentimental items, collections from old hobbies, my childhood playthings, and clothes I no longer love.


It’s kind of ripping the bandaid. It does feel good, gaining some much needed agency.


Tonight, Ding won the chess world champs. Chinese represent after Magnus’ dynasty. It makes me so happy to see him win against the odds, against Nepo.


Cheers, to the next 10 years.
