# Teething issues


Other than my two-week recovery from a mysterious cough, developing Astronot will take some larger delays. Here is a round up of issues along with the simplest solutions (in parenthesis):

1. **Little robustness**: an unstable database. (Shift YAML in markdown to database fields)
2. **No capability** to host images. (Explore use of an image framework such as unpic/astro)
3. **Unpleasant page load** in Multi Page Applications, route changes. (Switch to client side rendering frameworks such as Next.js or Remix)
4. **Stacking complexity** lack of written tests. (Be more objective oriented, pre-define them and write them)
5. **No ease** of use. (Reprioritise, rethink the intended users for the product)
